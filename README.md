## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Methodology BEM
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS

### What I learned

I gained more experience in analyzing layouts to better write page markup and styles. I also gained skills in working with adaptive layout for different devices. It was very useful to work with fetch requests to get data, processing them and writing asynchronous functions. I learned how to dynamically change content on the page and worked a bit on my own slider.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to focus on building more dynamic sites using different frameworks and preprocessors that can speed up my development.

## Acknowledgments

I am grateful to Fronted Mentor for providing various interesting assignments and layouts for pumping up my skils, with which I can practice and learn.
